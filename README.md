## Description

This module configures an Erlang package repository and then installs the Erlang language packages.

## Setup

### What erlang affects

* erlang repository files
* erlang package

### Beginning with erlang

Getting started with this module is extremely simple. We've chosen sane defaults for
both Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/RHEL OS's, so all you have to do is add the following to
your puppet code:

```puppet
include erlang
```

## Usage

All options and configuration can be done through interacting with the parameters
on the main `erlang` class.
These are now documented via [Puppet Strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings)

You can view example usage in [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).

## Reference

See [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).

## Limitations

Bintray was supported as an upstream repository in the past. Since jfrog shut it
down and deleted the repositories, Bintray support was removed from this module.
